To run the leaf classifier:
1) Place addedgefeatures.py, adddistancelevelsetfeatures.py, addcomfeatures.py, and analyzeallfeatures.py in a directory with train.csv. Add ratiostest.csv, as generated by Matt's code, to the same directory. In this directory, place a folder named 'images' with the leaf images.
2) Run addedgefeatures.py (1-2hrs), adddistancelevelsetfeatures.py (a few minutes), and addcomfeatures.py (a few minutes). This will generated the additional feature data.
3) Run analyzeallfeatures.py. This will run the classifier.
